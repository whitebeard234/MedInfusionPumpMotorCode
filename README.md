The medical infusion pumpâ€™s main purpose is to make the injection process automated. It
was originally meant for infants; therefore, the syringe must be pushed slowly to have the
medicine injected slowly into the patient. The project output can inject the medicine
automatically and safely. It has been programmed in a way that it cannot overdose the patient. It
has been integrated with a progress tracker for the user to know if the medicine has been injected
throughout the input injection time.
